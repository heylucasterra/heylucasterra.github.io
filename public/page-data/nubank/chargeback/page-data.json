The team focused on maintaining services and optimizing customer support processes. I had recently joined Nubank and was looking for problems to solve when I met Gustavo Mendes, a product manager that had also joined.</p>\n<p>Gustavo gave me a brief overview of what he knew about chargebacks. It seemed complicated and full of ramifications/ edge-cases – which made me accept the challenge. During our first month working in chargeback, we spent several hours working as Xpeers (Nubank’s customer support heroes). We learned how to use back-office tools, got familiar with dispute processes, and understood the various backend services. </p>\n<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 940px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 63.829787234042556%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Left: Inácio, one of our Xpeers from the night-shift spent several hours teaching me the way to great customer support.

Gustavo and I now were at Nubank for around 2 months and agreed on building a longer-term vision with the rest of the team. We had a couple of projects going on, but they felt too reactive. Building our own strategy was the way to do proactive work and assure the experience was still the best in the industry in the years to come.</p>\n<p>I suggested making a team dynamics, involving our stakeholders. For this activity, I brought an incomplete front-page of a newspaper. The headline read as the nightmare of any Xpeer: Nubank’s customer base growing from 2MM to 50MM people over the next 2 years — without growing the customer support team. The title, however, indicated we had been successful in this mission. The rest of the page was blank and the activities we played helped us frame the pillars towards success.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 940px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 63.829787234042556%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"I used a newspaper as an artifact to set a vision for Chargeback. &lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: var(--font-mid-contrast);&quot;&gt;Note: NPS isn&#39;t a metric I recommend nor incentivize.

The best way to spread the vision was to print copies of the front page and put them on the walls, so our 127 team members would be in contact with it every day.</p>\n<h3>New opportunities arise</h3>\n<p>New project opportunities started popping. Xpeers were super attentive to things in their routines that could push us away from the front page — like if they could see it fading, Back to the Future style. More and more people sent us feedback on XpeerVoice and came to talk to me about things that were… suboptimal. A good example of that was this spreadsheet:</p>\n<p>//Figure: GIF spreadsheet.</p>\n<p>This spreadsheet was used to control rebuttals: chargebacks that were “denied” and we wouldn’t be able to reimburse our clients. It seemed obvious that it was one of the blockers for us to scale the operation. With a simple effort × impact matrix it was crystal clear: we had found our first big impact project to tackle.</p>\n<p>Designing this tool took me close to 2 months with multiple iterations every week always followed by demos and usability tests with Xpeers. It was a complex product to design but one of the main benefits of building an internal tool was that I could move fast. Sitting next to my customers was optimal for shorter feedback cycles and boosted product iteration.</p>\n<p>//Figure: Close-ups. Open sans → Graphik; Checkboxes;  </p>\n<p>While I can’t show you the tool, here are some of my favourite details of the work I’ve done</p>\n<p>When we got to a version that attended Xpeer needs, we ran a final session with a group of people that had never seen the tool before. They were asked to perform the most frequent and critical actions from their routine and show us how they would do it. People who never saw that interface knew how to use it. I was confident to move with my solution.</p>\n<h3>Shipping less than minimum</h3>\n<p>While the version we had in our hands seemed good enough to ship — and part of the back-end work had already started in parallel to the design explorations — it would still take a couple more months to get there. Another benefit of building internal products is that teams feel more comfortable taking bigger risks. I’m a big supporter of keeping things scrappy, and that’s exactly what we did.</p>\n<p>Gustavo and I agreed to roll out the new tool. It had around 15% of the features I planned and they would enable Xpeers to complete less than 40% of the jobs using it. This is a message from Pato, one of our Xpeers after his first day using the tool.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 648px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 43.40425531914894%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"“My overview of the first day using the {{ToolName}} in 100% of the cases: It took me 3h30 to do 50 cases.

He was very polite trying to blame his lack of familiarity with the tool, but we were the ones to blame. We released something that was barely useful. Pato still needed to shift tabs multiple times and use the old spreadsheet for more than half of his tasks.</p>\n<p>After the first release, Gustavo and I called Xpeers using the new tool to help us with prioritization. We organized the backlog based on Xpeer feedback and gave them visibility of the features coming on the following week. This followed until we received the following messages:</p>\n<p>//Figure: Shiny design.</p>\n<p>I can’t really disclose the final design of that tool here, but imagine a shiny design in the picture above. Little by little we got closer to that and there’s some of the </p>\n<h3>Impact</h3>\n<p>The new tool reduced task completion time from 3 minutes to 27 seconds. Not only did it help the Xpeer team from growing but also it helped shrink it. This meant some of the Xpeers from our team could now focus on other contact reasons. </p>\n<p>We saved Nubank a few million Brazilian reais per year and changed the internal perception about the team. Chargeback went from the underdog to a team software engineers asked to work on.</p>\n<p>One the personal side, working with this team was one of my best moments at Nubank. After working in a couple of other projects there, Gustavo and I decided to pursue different opportunities in the company. I started leading design for Credit Card and he led the team building the customer support platform. Our partnership, however, was just beginning. After that we jump-started several personal projects and internal side-quests together.</p>\n<h3>Learnings</h3>\n<p>Design is about investing in the user’s experience before and after things go wrong. Simplifying thelife and work of customer support as simple as possible goes a long way to make them focus on what they do best: build trust with customers and foster empathy with them during product prioritisation.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/nubank/chargeback","date":"2018","lastEdit":null,"featuredImage":"./gatsby-astronaut.png","role":"Product and Design","accent":"rgb(138, 5, 190)","color":"red","title":"A north for chargebacks","subtitle":"Co-creating a fresh, shared vision of the future — and making sure the team navigates in that direction.","designteam":"Gustavo Mendes, Sofia Hernandez, Luiz Borba and others","topics":"product design, user research","published":false,"impact":"small","company":"Nubank","location":"São Paulo, Brazil","icon":null}}},"pageContext":{}}}
