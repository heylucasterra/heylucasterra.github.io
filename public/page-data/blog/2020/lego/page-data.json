As you might have noticed, I ended up taking a little bit of a hiatus as the world got a bit crazy ever since<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>. But here we are, learning how to get to the other side of this together — even if from a distance.</p>\n<p>This past month I've avoided jumping into code after work so I had a some time away from the screen. I think I'm getting the hang of it now and am more comfortable to slowly get back to this website.</p>\n<p>I wanted to talk about some of the key layout bricks used here as well as how I'm structuring the bits of code that make them.</p>\n<h3>Type scales</h3>\n<p>Most of the major styling frameworks today — Gatsby's standard included — have pretty decent type scales. I'm not the kind of designer that normally pushes for HUGE fonts and also care about accessibility enough to avoid 12pt body text. For a project like this, using all styles from <code>h1</code> to <code>h6</code> plus paragraph seems a bit of an overkill. I won't be using these many and  think 4 styles might be more than enough for now.</p>\n<p>For the <code>font-size</code> at HTML level I am using Gatsby's default of <code>112.5%/1.45em</code> (18px instead of browser's default 16px). And then for each text tag I'm using rem units. I have completely discarded h6, getting me 5 title styles and one for paragraphs. As I'm using Markdown to write 99.99% of this website I also decided the <code>h4</code> will have the same size as <code>p</code>, with just a different weight and color, giving me more flexibility when writing <code>.md</code> files.</p>\n<p>After some minor letter-spacing adjustments, here's what I got.\n[image showing all 5 type sizes and color]</p>\n<h3>Variables</h3>\n<p>For now I'm using mostly colour variables but this will likely expand in the future to spacing too.\n[img showing all the different colours in use]</p>\n<h3>Light and dark</h3>\n<p>In the future this site will support different colour themes — but if you know how to inspect code in you can already see it in action by adding <code>data-theme=\"dark\"</code> inside the <code>&#x3C;html></code> tag. Trying to keep the layout clean and add colour in the details (primary links, code, selection, etc)\n[image showing light and dark themes at work]</p>\n<h3>Grid and page body</h3>\n<p>This is going to be a unpopular opinion. For the past couple of years I've been designing mostly for mobile and my process has involved very little — if any — usage of grids. While many of my friends are skeptical about this opinion, grids for me have a similar importance to setting the table for dinner.</p>\n<p>Setting the table is an important part of the dinner ritual, and of course one can spend hours making it perfect — aligning silver and dishes, matching table cloth and napkins — but table setting isn't anyone's final goal (I think). I'm a fan of simpler table arrangements that succeed at putting the meal in the spotlight.</p>\n<p>For this project I am going with a single column layout where other elements will break this vertical monolyth. Yet, I don't feel like I need a grid or columns right now.</p>\n<p>Some of my friends are very skeptical of this approach but truth is: if you know your way with code, a project like this don't require a previously set grid and can make good use of more automatic layout rules (flexbox's <code>justify-content</code> is a good example of that).</p>\n<p>As mentioned <a href=\"/blog/2020/defining-constraints\">before</a>, I’m challenging myself to build this without any <code>@media</code> in my code, meaning the same lines of style should work across different sizes of devices. For the body of text, I’m using a simple <code>max-width: 60rem</code>.</p>\n<h3>Markdown and frontmatter</h3>\n<p>I’m using Markdown to write every page in this website except for the home. Making Markdown powerful is a critical part for the success and speed of posting new work so I'm writing the React template in a way that will allow me to control things such as background colour for an icon or images all via frontmatter.</p>\n<p>[Img/gif of editing logo color via Markdown]</p>\n<h3>Case studies and blog posts</h3>\n<p>Building the </p>\n<h3>Navigation</h3>\n<p>Links\nButton (do I need it though?)</p>\n<h3>Code snippets</h3>\n<h3><em>In my mind</em> page</h3>\n<p>This will likely be the last part to ship and will likely change a lot until then. But I want to have a space where I share things not necessarily related to work, like what I'm listening/reading/new habits etc. Still </p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>In case you’re reading this from the future, as I write we’re amid the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/2020/lego","date":"","lastEdit":"April 30, 2020","featuredImage":"","role":null,"accent":"","color":null,"title":"Redesign: Lego","subtitle":"","designteam":null,"topics":"design, meta, redesign, typography","published":true,"impact":null,"company":null,"location":"São Paulo, Brazil","icon":null}}},"pageContext":{}}}
