And by making sense he meant we needed to make sure whatever we were building was addressing our intentions. For this design to be successful, we needed to make sure we had the right intention. This still resonates everytime I begin a new project, this one included.</p>\n<p>Making sure I have the right intent will save me time and keep me focused in the goal of both shipping my personal page faster — but also making sure I am spending my time to learn what I really need to get this up and running.</p>\n<p><strong>My intention for this page is to broadcast my thoughts.</strong> Showcasing projects I have worked on, yeah but also to share what's on my mind.</p>\n<p>This week I put together a short list of definitions (read constraints) that will impact the shape what's coming out from this project. These are the constraints as the backbone for this project:</p>\n<h3>I'm using <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"nofollow\">GatsbyJS</a> to build</h3>\n<p>Learning React has been on my list for way too many years now and I only used it to build small personal projects or to do minor tweaks at someone else's code at work. I have used Jekyll to build my portfolio in the past and after a while it just became difficult to maintain (aka I lost the fight to Ruby).\nin popularity over the past few years. </p>\n<p>The main reasons for adopting Gatsby were: React, speed and how aparently <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2017-07-19-creating-a-blog-with-gatsby/\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"nofollow\">easy to create a blog</a> it is.</p>\n<h3>Goodbye Tachyons</h3>\n<p>For the past 4 or 5 years <a href=\"https://tachyons.io/\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tachyons.io</a> has been my go-to CSS solution. When I think about styling a web page my brain thinks <code>fl w-two-thirds</code> and other stuff like that. I want the layout for my website to be dead simple so I'll try to stay away from existing frameworks. Frameworks will allow me to do too much, too easily.</p>\n<h3>Device agnostic code/layout</h3>\n<p>As I'm ditching CSS frameworks, getting to a layout and font size that work across all devices will be important. In practice, this means I won't be using <code>@media</code> in my stylesheet as it makes things more difficult to maintain. I also think this will add some spice to this project as I force myself to optimize for simpler layouts.</p>\n<h3>Variables</h3>\n<p>Variables are important. I'll use them mostly for colours for now and to, at some point, be more gentle on your eyes as you might read this at night.</p>\n<p>Yeah, so this is it for now. Time to read some documentation now.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/2020/defining-constraints","date":"","lastEdit":"February 27, 2020","featuredImage":"","role":null,"accent":"","color":null,"title":"Redesign: Defining constraints","subtitle":"","designteam":null,"topics":"design, meta, redesign,","published":true,"impact":null,"company":null,"location":"São Paulo, Brazil","icon":null}}},"pageContext":{}}}
