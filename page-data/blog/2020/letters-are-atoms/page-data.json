Since then the world got a bit crazy (in case you're reading this several years from now, we're going through the massive epidemic of the covid-19).  -->\n<p>Picking fonts and testing is a very difficult process. Combining different fonts and make them match baseline is even tougher and time consuming. For now, I'll be happy to pick one font only that works for both titles and body. After some digging I got to 5 sans-serif finalists that point in two different directions.</p>\n<h3>Direction A</h3>\n<p>This group of typefaces have expression while still extremely simple. I want my typeface of choice to feel humble, yet with personality. But not distracting. Let's take a look at them.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.google.com/u/0/d/1490wGraIKHS8hxs11D_dg-7ZIF-End3j=w2880-h1596-iv1\"><a href=\"https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/national/\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"nofollow\">National 2</a> by <a href=\"https://klim.co.nz/\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"nofollow\">Klim</a> (left), <a href=\"https://www.optimo.ch/typefaces_Theinhardt.html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"nofollow\">Theinhardt</a> by <a href=\"https://www.optimo.ch/\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"nofollow\">Optimo</a> (center) and <a href=\"https://neubauberlin.com/project/neubau-national/\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"nofollow\">NB National Std</a> by <a href=\"https://neubauberlin.com/project/neubau-national/\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"nofollow\">Neubau</a> (right).</p>\n<p>In the example above, they are all set at equal sizes (as I write this I also realized two of them also share the same name). Theinhardt feels too dull when placed among the other two. I appreciate how Klim's National 2 seem to have received a lot of love and thought in it's project, specially in the terminations where you can clearly see the changes in width, with a bit of calligraphic influence. Neubau's NB National on the other hand has the most obvious geometry. Look at that perfect small-caps <code>a</code>...</p>\n<p>Let's see how they render in a paragraph.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.google.com/u/0/d/1PivcnzIyfy3Bk2asAS1B7GBgd5TxlBFK=w2880-h1596-iv1\">Klim's National 2 (top), Optimo's Theinhardt (mid), Neubau's NB National (bottom)</p>\n<p>A lot has changed. Theinhardt suddenly doesn't feel as dull. It's actually the easiest to read, even if you zoom out or try it in smaller sizes. I think most people would agree that National 2 on the top is real delight and NB National might work for titles but for the body it simply sets an awkward rythm.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Direction B</h3>\n<p>I know, after a month looking at typefaces I have Graphik in this list. I know it's been overused but the main reason I'm bringing it here is that I found another font, called Abitare and discarded it because Graphik seems better solved. And then I found Regola, which is an imperfect typeface but something in it makes it very attractive. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.google.com/u/0/d/145pCDw1fo3I1oVSisjOl6NRGCFxFBKP5=w2880-h1596-iv1\"><a href=\"https://commercialtype.com/catalog/graphik\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"nofollow\">Graphik</a> by <a href=\"https://commercialtype.com/\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"nofollow\">Commercial Type</a> (left) and <a href=\"https://t-wo.it/font/regolapro/\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"nofollow\">Regola Pro</a> by <a href=\"https://t-wo.it/\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"nofollow\">Think Work Observe</a> (right).</p>\n<p>At the first look, these two might look pretty much the same. Give it another look. I have been observing how they solved different letters and also tried them in different explorations (might share my experiments some other time) and it's been illuminating to see the differences between these two. </p>\n<p>In the example above, Regola is visibly wider than Graphik and set at the same weight it also seems slightly thicker. The small-caps <code>a</code> has more white space to breathe and you'll notice there's something in the corners of the <code>Z</code> that make Graphik seem more fragile.</p>\n<p>Let's have a look at a short sentence.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.google.com/u/0/d/1votX12HM5wbScFhtiqtAUNWQgb85Xyy2=w2880-h1596-iv1\">Graphik (top) and Regola (bottom)</p>\n<p>I was completely wrong when I said Regola takes more horizontal space than Graphik. Look at how Regola ends the sentence almost a <code>n</code> unit before Graphik. I was also lucky to steal this excerpt from Frank Herbert's Dune (which I am currently reading) and notice how the <code>?</code> is very different for these fonts.</p>\n<p>What about a longer paragraph?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.google.com/u/0/d/1hwo4PGlO7x1b1CbllH2CqCrQy8W1pzGh=w2880-h1596-iv1\">Graphik (top) and Regola (bottom)</p>\n<p>Something bugged me about Graphik and I didn't know why. Until someone at work showed me how the ascendants are taller than the capital letters and it made total sense to me. Regola feels</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.google.com/u/0/d/1T4-FXaoJ0X0cyV0YrezHmCW8iwnd-tLb=w2880-h1596-iv1\">Ascendants are taller than capital letters for Graphik.</p>\n<h3>Final Round</h3>\n<p>Regola and National were my favourites from a initial list of 10 fonts. How does one decide a winner for a typeface? As I mentioned before, I want it to have character while passing unnoticed to less attentive eyes. National is very delightful on the eyes but can seem too serious for a personal blog. Now that I have a page up and running, I decided  structure</p>\n<p>Yay, I think I got it. <strong>Regola is my new voice on the web.</strong>\nWith the atoms defined, it's time to think about the molecules.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://t-wo.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/RegolaPro-Gallery-2018-03-1.jpg\" alt=\"Regola Pro\"></p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/2020/letters-are-atoms","date":"","lastEdit":"March 04, 2020","featuredImage":"","role":null,"accent":"","color":null,"title":"Redesign: If words are molecules, letters are atoms","subtitle":"Finding a typeface to be my voice in the web.","designteam":null,"topics":"design, meta, redesign, typography","published":true,"impact":null,"company":null,"location":"São Paulo, Brazil","icon":null}}},"pageContext":{}}}
