Not only NPS <a href=\"\">can be considered harmful</a> but also it wasn’t actionable for teams to iterate on their features/products.\nSolution: a modular solution that could help teams evaluate specific flows/features and know what to improve next. The design came down to a simple drawer that we could add to any flow in the app to collect customer feedback about what went great/didn’t work as they expected.</p>\n<h3>Transaction Details</h3>\n<pre><code>hero: Before/After\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Problem</h4>\n<p>Customers reached the transaction detail screen but couldn’t find where to report an issue with the merchant or the purchase.
