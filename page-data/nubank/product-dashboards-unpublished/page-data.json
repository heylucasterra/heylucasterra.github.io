After a few rounds of user interviews in our projects, it was clear: <em>our features would struggle to coexist in NuConta’s main screen.</em>NuConta’s 6 months old interface was already bloated.</p>\n<br>\n<blockquote>\n<h5 style=\"margin-bottom:1rem\">Project Goal</h5>\n<h3 style=\"margin-top:1rem; text-align: center\"> Open the way for NuConta's growth.</h3>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some of the questions and challenges faced:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h4>Do people understand the graph?</h4>\n<p>The original UI was ~50% a bar chart. When launching the product the team didn’t spend much time evaluating if people understood/ saw value in it. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4>People’s mental model was different from how the product works</h4>\n<p>Our mix of a checking + savings account generated a lot of buzz but that wasn’t enough. Customers wanted to separate their money in two different categories: <code>to spend</code> and <code>to save</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4>Unintuitive gestures</h4>\n<p>Searching for the term “NuConta” returned <a href=\"https://www.techtudo.com.br/dicas-e-tutoriais/2018/04/como-encontrar-comprovantes-de-transferencias-da-nuconta.ghtml\" target=\"blank\" style=\"cursor: url('./images/card.png')\">multiple tutorials</a> on how to access the list of transactions and other essencial features for customers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4>Upcoming feature boom</h4>\n<p>The product was a skeleton of a bank account — with no debit card; ATM withdrawal; auto-debit and other basic features. The number of features would grow increasingly fast and we needed to improve visibility of new product offerings.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"explorations\" style=\"position:relative;\">Explorations<a href=\"#explorations\" aria-label=\"explorations permalink\" class=\"header-anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"20\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"20\" fill=\"var(--font-mid-contrast)\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>Having defined the main goals, I spent several afternoons pairing with my colleagues in the Design Studio.
