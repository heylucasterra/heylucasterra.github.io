This is not a case about a specific product but rather a register of my memories of a really good time in my life, written in hindsight.</p>\n<h3>Joining a team focused on operations</h3>\n<p>In my early days at Nubank, the Chargeback<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup> team needed some product love. Over the previous year (or two) the team focused on improving internal flows and the optimizing the Xpeer 2 operation (Xpeers are our internal customer support heroes).</p>\n<p>Along with me, a Product Manager named Gustavo Mendes — with whom I were to establish a long term partnership for both personal personal and internal side quests — joined the team. During our first month we spent several hours understanding the different backend services built to receive customer complaints, trial, send it to MasterCard and also using our internal tools to help customers.</p>\n<p>Figure: early sketches/ working with Xpeers.</p>\n<h3>Listening internal and external customers</h3>\n<p>With a MacGyver like Zapier integration we were able to collect customer and Xpeer feedback, we were quickly gaining context about the squad and our customers as well as identifying product opportunities for both the internal tools and the customer facing product in our mobile app.</p>\n<h3>The need for a longer term vision</h3>\n<p>While there would always exist ways to improve how the customer support operation worked, the Chargeback team needed a longer term vision. And while our main goal at that time was to building a new back-office tool to support how our agents at reviewing chargebacks rebutted by the credit card brand, we agreed that building a lasting longer term vision for the team was the most important thing we could do to keep the product running and clients having the best experience they could in such a stressful moment of their lives.</p>\n<p>Together with other key stakeholders in the team we put together a team dynamic. All we had was the title in the front-page of a blank newspaper that translated the nightmare of any customer support agent: our client base being multiplied by over 25✕ in less than 2 years. The title, however, indicated we were successful.</p>\n<p>That was the starting point for a discussion that lead a team of software engineers, business architects, customer support and other people from other teams in the company (including the COO) to think about the things that </p>\n<h3>Spreading the word</h3>\n<p>Printing and placing on the walls so our 132 agents could see and were aligned.</p>\n<h3>Impact</h3>\n<p>People coming to talk about things that were not going to help us get to that vision.</p>\n<p>This is a story with no </p>\n<p>Oh yeah, and what about the tool we were working on you may ask. It turned out to be very successful. We were able to slice the delivery into multiple steps, not only stop the customer support team from growing but actually reduce it so they could prioritise other parts of the company that issued more tickets then we were doing at that time. But that’s I might be sharing some other time.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/nubank/chargeback","date":"2018","lastEdit":null,"featuredImage":"./gatsby-astronaut.png","role":"Product designer","accent":"rgb(138, 5, 190)","color":"red","title":"A north for chargebacks","subtitle":"Co-creating a fresh vision of future and prioritising product work in a team focused on optimizing operation processes.","designteam":"Gustavo Mendes, Sofia Hernandez, Luiz Borba, Lucas Alencar, Tiago Fabre, Estevam Machado, Felipe Dau, Felipe Fabretti and many others","topics":"product design,","published":false,"impact":"small","company":"Nubank","location":"São Paulo, Brazil","icon":null}}},"pageContext":{}}}
