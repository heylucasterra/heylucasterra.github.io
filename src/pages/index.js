Over the past couple of years I have helped evolve the product, shape the team, nurture the culture and see us grow from a flat, everybody-does-it-all group of generalists to a 70+ international design organization with people dedicated to building the motion, illustration, research and ux writing for the product and brand that over 20MM brazilians interact with.</p>
