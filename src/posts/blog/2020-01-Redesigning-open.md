I decided to redesign my website. Around 3 years ago I removed all the projects from this url and turned it into a sober "about me" page.

I want this new version to get live updated as the process of redesigning unfolds. This way others can get a sense of progress just as much as much as I do. Looking for inspiration on how to make this as open as possible, I stumbled on Jonnie's and Frank's redesigns and decided to follow along. This will be a fun adventure as I it will also be my first medium sized project in React for the first time.

This first post will serve as the `Index` for documenting the process.
