I decided to redesign my website. Around 3 years ago I removed all the projects from this url and turned it into a sober "about me" page.

I want this new version to get live updated as the process of redesigning unfolds. This way others can get a sense of progress just as much as I do. Looking for inspiration on how to make this as open as possible, I stumbled on [Jonnie's](https://destroytoday.com/blog/hello-world) and [Frank's](https://frankchimero.com/blog/2019/redesign/) redesigns and decided to follow along. This will also be a fun little adventure as I put my hands in GraphQL for the first time.

This first post will serve as the `Index` for documenting the process.
