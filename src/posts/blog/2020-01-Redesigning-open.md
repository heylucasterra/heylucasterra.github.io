2020 started and I decided to redesign my website. A couple of years ago I removed all the projects from this url and turned it into a sad "about me" page.

I wanted it to be updated during the process of redesigning, so people could have a sense of progress just as much as much as I do. It will take a while to get it done as I adventure into React for the first time, but the goal here is not to rush.

This first post will also serve as the `Index` for documenting the process.
