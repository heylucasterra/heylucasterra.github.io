2020 started and I decided to redesign my website. A couple of years ago I removed all the projects from my personal url and turned it into a sad "about me" page.

I wanted this website to be updated in during the process of the redesing, so people could have a sense of profress as much as I do. It will take a while as I adventure into React for the first time. This post will also serve as the `Index` for the documentation of the process – as detailed below.
