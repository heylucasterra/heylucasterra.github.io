Another year came in and I decided to redesign my website. Over the past couple of years I removed all the projects from my personal url and turned this into a sad "about me" page.

I wanted this website to be updated in real time so people accessing it could watch the evolution week over week. This post will serve as the `Index` for this documentation.
