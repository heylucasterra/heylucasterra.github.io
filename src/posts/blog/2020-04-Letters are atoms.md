Different people have different ways of expressing themselves. From the way we speak to body language, there are several ways to identify or recognize someone with looking at them. Typefaces are the equivalent to that for any written medium.

Here's a practical example: Valter Hugo Mãe is one of my favourite contemporary authors. I usually buy his books from the same Biblioteca Azul collection as [Silva](https://blackletra.com/fonts/silva_text/) made by Brazilian type foundry Black Letra already morphed into his voice as I read it.
