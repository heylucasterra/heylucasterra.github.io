For quite some time now I have cultivated this [personal collection](https://www.gettoby.com/p/w4gnsx3zmfsh) of websites that really caught my attention at some point navigating the web. 

One of my main goals with the redesign is to make this website more about the stories I want to tell, and not only focus on the technical design work. Here are some of websites I think have a good mix of personal/work either because their authors have a dedicated page to talk about themselves; by showing their thinking in their portfolios or even by having a strong voice on their blog.
