Another year came in and I decided to redesign my website. Over the past couple of years I have removed all projects and this became less of a collection of my work and more of a "about me" page.

The whole idea was pretty much stolen from [Frank Chimero's](https://www.frankchimero.com) post about making this process in the open. In my case however I wanted this website to be updated in real time so people accessing it could see the evolution week over week.
