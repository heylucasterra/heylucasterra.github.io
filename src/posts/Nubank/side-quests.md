### My relationship with side quests
The thing I love the most about working in the product — rather than consulting, for example — is that it allows me to go beyond well scoped projects and push the future of the company (and the people supporting it) into new and exciting directions.

This is one the things I love the most about my role at Nubank. While many of these self-initiated projects can't be publicly disclosed, here's a small sample of unpretentious work that turned out influencing product strategy, processes or served as housekeeping/ quick-wins.

### App for interview, 2019
<br>

![](./images/app-for-interview.gif)

| 🤔 Problem | 🧩 Solution |
|---|---|
| During Nubank's hypergrowth, it was difficult to keep track of all hiring interviews happening. Recruiting tools didn't optimize for taking and sharing notes on candidates. | A tool that displays the different hiring questions for each position, space to add notes and an easy way to share the scorecard for each candidate |

| 🤝 Team | 🕒 Duration |
|---|---|
| Lucas Terra, Gustavo Mendes | Around 8 weeks, with multiple iterations along the way. |

| 🎯 Impact | |
|---|---|
| As of May 2019, there are now over 25 employees using our tool for phone screening candidates. | |

### Transaction Details, 2018
![Previous vs. New design for transaction details](./images/Transaction-Details-Old-vs-New.png)

| 🤔 Problem | 🧩 Solution |
|---|---|
| <ol><li>Customers got in touch with customer support to take actions they already could do via app.</li><li>Visuals were deprecated in comparison to the rest of the app; </li><li>There was a number of non-obvious interactions — such as swiping to reveal the transaction location. </li></ol>| A revamp of the transaction details screen with clearer actions available. <br><br> <br><h4>🎯 Impact</h4><br> Reduced in 3,56p.p. the contact rate for some of the biggest customer support queues. |

### Organizing Amplitude Events, 2018
![Used scraped data from monitored events to help the PM team do some housekeeping](./images/amplitude-printable-post-its.png)

| 🤔 Problem | 🧩 Solution |
|---|---|
| There were too many events being monitored in our analytics. Nubank was spending funds in a sub-optimal way given the number of unused/ deprecated events. | A work session with PMs across the company to map which events were still necessary and trace a plan for data governance at the company. I scraped data on the events from the Amplitude website and printed them in sticky notes to facilitate the session. |

| 🕒 Duration | 🎯 Impact |
|---|---|
| 3 weeks for preparation, host the event and analyse/create a plan with our learnings | Deflected a 40% price increase in the tool subscription — can't reveal figures but think big. This also guided a clearer set of rules and principles for creating using and maintaining data at Nubank. |
