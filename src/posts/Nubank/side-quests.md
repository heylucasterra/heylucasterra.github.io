###UX Thermometer
####Team
Self initiated, but several people included along the way
####Problem
Product teams uses NPS as a metric to understand user perception/product changes impact on the the customer experience. Not only NPS [can be considered harmful]() but also it wasn’t actionable for teams to iterate on their features/products. 
Solution: a modular solution that could help teams evaluate specific flows/features and know what to improve next. The design came down to a simple drawer that we could add to any flow in the app to collect customer feedback about what went great/didn’t work as they expected.

###Transaction Details
    hero: Before/After

####Problem
Customers reached the transaction detail screen but couldn't find where to report an issue with the merchant or the purchase. Also, the visuals were fully deprecated in comparison to the rest of the app and it was full of hidde interactions (like tapping on the left to reveal the map location of where the transaction happened).

###App for interview
####Team
Lucas Terra, Gustavo Mendes
####Problem
During Nubank's hypergrowth, it was difficult to keep track of all the interviews happening and tools for recruiting didn't optimize for note taking.
####Solution
A tool that shows different hiring questions for each position
####Duration
8 weeks


###Organizing Amplitude Events
####Team
Lucas Terra, Gustavo Mendes
####Problem
Too many events in Amplitude (the tool we used to instrument our app) and the company was charged by number of events.
####Solution
Fostering communication with different teams to know how they were using existing events and what was/wasn't necessary for them. After that, cleaning and defining better rules for instrumenting app events
####Impacts
Savings in $ for the company (can't reveal numbers here for obvious reasons).
