### On side quests
The thing I love the most about working on the product is that it allows me to go beyond well scoped projects and push the team and the product into new and exciting directions. 

This is the most exciting part of my work at Nubank and while many of them can't be publicly disclosed, here you'll find a small number of self initiated projects that turned out to influence our strategy, processes or short-term quick-wins.

### App for interview, 2019

| ðŸ¤” Problem | ðŸŽ¯ Solution |
|---|---|
| During Nubank's hypergrowth, it was difficult to keep track of all hiring interviews happening. Recruiting tools didn't optimize for taking and sharing notes. | A tool that displays the different hiring questions for each position, and an easy way to share the scorecard for each candidate |

#### Team
Lucas Terra, Gustavo Mendes

#### Duration
Around 8 weeks, with multiple iterations along the way.

### UX Thermometer, 2019
#### Team
Self initiated, but several people included along the way
#### ðŸ¤” Problem
NPS isn't granular nor actionable enough to help teams make product decisions â€” besides [being considered harmful](). 
#### ðŸŽ¯ Solution
A modular in-app component that helps teams collect user feedback for specific flows/ features and make better decisions.

### Transaction Details, 2018
hero: Before/After

#### ðŸ¤” Problem
Customers didn't report an issue with the merchant or the purchase. Also, the visuals were fully deprecated in comparison to the rest of the app and it was full of hidde interactions (like tapping on the left to reveal the map location of where the transaction happened).

    gif: Add tag prototypes
    Report button states, new component
    duration: 2 weeks

#### Solution
Match supply and demand: a fresh transaction details with clearer call to action. 

#### Impact
Reduced in 3,56p.p. the contact rate for chargeback.

### Organizing Amplitude Events
#### Team
Lucas Terra, Gustavo Mendes
#### ðŸ¤” Problem
Too many events in Amplitude (the tool we used to instrument our app) and the company was charged by number of events.
#### ðŸŽ¯ Solution
Fostering communication with different teams to know how they were using existing events and what was/wasn't necessary for them. After that, cleaning and defining better rules for instrumenting app events
#### Impact
Saved a 40% price increase in the tool subscription â€” can't reveal figures but think big ;-)
