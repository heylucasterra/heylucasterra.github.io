### Joining credit card
When I joined Nubank, my interest for human behaviour, business, data models and the dry access to credit in my home country swiftly drew me to our core product: the credit card.

Back then, designers were focused on shipping new products and I was excited to push our core product to the next level.

### Embracing leadership
As the company jumped into hypergrowth, it was clear Nubank required more design leaders. I stepped up and was fortunate to help build this team from the ground up.

Credit card has been my home at Nubank for the past 3 years and the best team of product designers, user researchers and content strategists I have ever worked with.

Let’s dive into each of these areas and some of the work done behind each of them. As with any great band, these were a group effort and not my accomplish alone.

I'm proud of how we optimised our team for autonomy and collaboration, making this is a collective story of success. I'll try to cover the surface, but don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:hey@lucasterra.com?subject=Building a Design Team">reach out</a> if you'd like to learn more.

## 1. Building a strong design team

![A daily sync from the early days of our team · with Diego, Leticia and Egon](/images/Daily-sync-from-when-we-were-a-small-team.jpg)

### Finding the right people
In 2018, Nubank hit puberty and was starting to grow fast. As with any adolescent, different parts of the body grew faster than others. Design was one that took longer to develop.

The first three people I helped hire (in the picture above) were two product designers and a UX researcher. We all had a very complementary set of personalities, backgrounds and technical skills — which added a ton whenever we seeked a different perspective on the problems we had at hand.

We matched our gradient of skills and personal interests with specific moments of people's journey with their credit cards. For example: Diego's deep apreciation for details and visual design made him the perfect candidate to lead design for our rewards program. My interest in data and business led me to stay closer to how our limit increase policies should work.

A few months in and it was now their time to also help find the best talent our there, so I shared my thoughts and learnings from interviewing design candidates.

![Personal notes on hiring, shared with early members of the team]()


### Evolving our rituals

In 2019 the team had doubled in size (around 6 people) and our rituals evolved a ton. We started sharing some of the housekeeping tasks so everybody was a leader in one direction. Diego and Ana, for example took over our team retrospectives and Amanda was nominated the "queen of design critiques", helping team members ensure they were getting the most out of their design crits.

### Working remote

More recently, during a team retrospective amidst the pandemic, we all brought up how we were struggling with calendar tetris, making space for collaboration and getting to know new team members. Ana, Rafa and Poly volunteer to tackle the problem and after a couple of discussions and feedback from the entire team organized a virtual "Design Studio Day" block on Thursdays. We now have a moment of the week to gather feedback, learn more about the other projects happening and get to know one another.

We usually stay connected on Discord where there are different rooms for different purposes (pick right one if you're looking for feedback). The agenda for the day varies depending on the week of the month. 

Growing a cohesive, connected and empowered team takes time. The integration and collaboration that comes from spending Thursdays together as a team has really paid off — especially over such a long period working from home.

## 2. Outlining our vision of the future

**While our vision of the future will always remain confidential, here are some of the bits pushing us into the right direction.**

### Spreading out the Nu magic

Nubank originally surprised customers with the level of thought and attention to critical moments. We stand out in the crowd for how we deal with bad experiences with our service. We excel at what other companies would see as "edge cases" — these are usually the most critical moments people have with your product, so we want to get them right.

Ana worked on a flow that empowers users to create agreements to pay off debt in the app, increasing by 20% the number of "healed" customers.

### Being respectful and transparent about how we use customer data

Credit analysis is known for coming across as a total enigma. Williams optimised the loading states in our app to be more transparent and educative about how we use customer data in their credit analysis whenever they ask for a limit increase in the app. This has had an impact in customer behaviour and also increased the limit utilization for customers who saw these loading states.

This pattern is now the new standard across the company as we persist on our fight against complexity.

![New loading states · by Williams]()


### Adapting to customers needs during the pandemic
The covid crisis in 2020 hit the whole world in many unexpected ways. In Brazil alone, over 8.9 million people lost their jobs from January to March. Out of the many improvements Amanda did in our app, offering better refinancing options and creating a hub for donations were the ones that helped both customers and Nubank get to the other side of this together.

### Expanding into new geographies
In 2019, Andre joined as our first designer in Mexico and in 2020, Santiago as the first designer in Colombia. In both countries, Credit Card was the first product we launched.

They have worked hard into expanding the frontiers of our product, originally designed for the Brazilian market, and translated and redesigned the experience so that it attends both user and regulator needs in our new markets. At the time of this writing, in December 2020 there are now X customers in Mexico and Y customers in our Colombia waitlist.

### Helping the next 50MM customers build their path to credit
Since mid-2019 most of my attention have been dedicated to helping the team find ways to accept more customers with a credit card. We're now slowly rolling out a program that helps them (re)build credit.

## 3. Fostering trust and collaboration with our partners
<!-- 
Within our design team, there are a couple of rituals that 
1. Creative sessions are a reserved space of the week where designers can decide to run a design critique, a team discussion, 
2. Team retros are for oiling up the engines. They're usually facilitated by Diego, who also excells at designing spreadsheets such as this one -->


### Mixing multiple views on customer understanding
Soon after Leticia joined, we kicked off a foundational research initiative in partnership with data scientists in the team. We used existing data to segment our ever growing customer base into smaller, more actionable behaviour buckets. We were later invited to present our method to leaders in the industry at UXR Conf.
