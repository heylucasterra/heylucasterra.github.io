### Joining credit card
When I joined Nubank, my interest for human behaviour, business, data models and the dry access to credit in my home country swiftly drew me to focus on Nubank’s core product: the credit card.

Back then, designers were focused on shipping new products and I was excited to push our core product to the next level.

### Embracing leadership
As the company jumped into hypergrowth, I organically leaned towards leadership and was fortunate to help build this team from the ground up.

Credit card has been my home at Nubank for the past 3 years and the best team of product designers, user researchers and content strategists I have ever worked with.

Let’s dive into each of these areas and some of the work done behind each of them. As with any great band, these were a group effort and not my accomplish alone.

I'm proud of how we optimised our team for autonomy and collaboration, making this is a collective story of success. I'll try to cover the surface, but if you'd like to learn more about any of these, feel free to <a href="mailto:hey@lucasterra.com?subject=Building a Design Team">reach me</a>.

## 1. Building a strong design team

![A daily sync from the early days of our team · with Diego, Leticia and Egon](/images/Daily-sync-from-when-we-were-a-small-team.jpg)

### Finding the right people
In 2018, Nubank hit puberty and was starting to grow fast. As with any adolescent, different parts of the body grew faster than others. Design was one that took longer to develop.

The first three people I helped hire (in the picture above) were two product designers and a UX researcher. We all had a very complementary set of personalities, backgrounds and technical skills, which was super helpful for asking for help and getting a different perspective on the problems we had at hand.

We matched our different skills and personal interests with specific moments of people's journey with their credit cards. For example, Diego's deep apreciation for details made him the best person to lead design for our rewards program while my interest in data and business led me to stay closer to how our limit increase policies should work.

A few months in and it was now their time to also help find the best talent our there, so I shared my thoughts and learnings from interviewing design candidates.

![Personal notes on hiring, shared with early members of the team]()


### Evolving our rituals

Fastforward to when the team had doubled in size (around 6 people) and our rituals had evolved a ton. We also started sharing some of the housekeeping tasks so everybody was a leader in one direction. Diego and Ana, for example took over our team retrospectives and Amanda was nominated the queen of design critiques, helping team members ensure they were making the most out of their design crits.

### Working as a remote team

More recently, during the pandemic we all struggled with calendar tetris, making space for collaboration and getting to know the new people joining the team. Ana, Rafa and Poly then organized an online "Design Studio Day" block on Thursdays so that we always have time in the week to focus in our work, gather feedback, learn more about what others are working on and get to know one another.

It takes time to make a team work, and even more time to make it work out. The integration an collaboration that comes with spending Thursdays together as a team has really paid off on the long-run.

## 2. Setting the vision
From early 2018 until early 2019 the design and product teams were so focused on the day-to-day that we barely had the means to think of the next semester (also because our customer base would suffer drastic shifts). In 2019, we started having weekly working sessions involving Product Designers, Product Managers, Product Marketing and UX Researchers.

These meetings took different shapes over the years but were important to give everyone in the room visibility about what was happening to the product and also be able to connect the different moving pieces. These sessions played a big role and open space for looking ahead into the future.

While our current vision of the future will always be confidential, here are some of the bits that are pushing us into that direction.

- Recover the magic by solving what were once "edge cases", led by both Ana Mê Collections agreements in app and Will in Limits


### Being respectful and transparent about user data
Williams refined loading states for moments where we're collecting or acessing user data, by bringing them to loading states.


### Being more adaptable to our customers needs (pandemic)
The world has changed drastically over the past 5 years. Mobile payments grew exponentially, Brazilians stopped paying fees for credit cards, the pandemic crisis made over X/Y brazilians loose their jobs. Over the year of 2020, we have worked on a number of initiatives that helped our customers get to the other side together. 

### Expanding into new geographies
- Launching Mexico, by Andre Mooij and Mateus Peixoto
– Launching Colombia, by Santiago Eastmann

### Preparing the path for the next 50MM customers
- Secured Card
- Building a path to credit for the next 25MM customers, led by myself and Rafa Rozendo


### Hitting refresh in our rewards program
- New ways for a credit card to work on, led by Amanda Elyss
- Ultravioleta, led by Amanda Legge and Diego Vieira

## 3. Fostering trust and collaboration
Trust is the seed for any autonomous and collaborative team. I feel like I've been lucky to work with people who I cou

Within our design team, there are a couple of rituals that 
1. Creative sessions are a reserved space of the week where designers can decide to run a design critique, a team discussion, 
2. Team retros are for oiling up the engines. They're usually facilitated by Diego, who also excells at designing spreadsheets such as this one

- Internal peers: critiques with Amanda Elyss and retros with Diego 
- External peers: collaborating on presentations, helping create a product review forum for the Credit Card, Lending and Collections teams

Things people told me that kept me engaged building this product and team:


>You have been invaluable at onboarding PMs in Credit Card
<br>— Mariana Penido, Head of Product for Credit Card

>The credit card business unit is the most innovative at Nubank. Not because you’re launching new products all the time, but because you’ve been successful at constantly questioning what has been true/ great in the past <br> — Renata Veiga, Design Manager for Lending products

>To me it’s 100% clear Lucas doesn't work for the Credit Card business unit — nor for Nubank — but for our customers. And he knows how to go all the way back to tell how these decisions have an impact on the business
<br>— Luiza Ferraz, Product Marketing Manager
