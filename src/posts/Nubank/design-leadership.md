### Context
I joined Nubank at the time we were a tightly-close team of 12 brand and product designers. My interests for human behaviour, business, data models and the dry access to credit in my home country swiftly drew me to focus on Nubank’s core product: the credit card.

### Growing the team
As the company jumped into hypergrowth, I organically leaned towards leadership and was fortunate to help build this team from 1 to 10+ designers.

Credit card has been my home at Nubank for the past 3 years and this is best team of product designers, user researchers and content strategists I have ever worked with.

### Impact
My main accomplishments were to
- Build and maintain a cohesive team of designers, obsessed about our current and future customers — and ready to help each other grow in their careers
- Help build a vision of the future that would keep our most established product always ahead of the curve
- Build trust and understanding of the impact of design with stakeholders in the business unit

Let’s dive into each of these areas and the work that went into making it happen. As with any great band, none of these pillars was my accomplishment alone. We have optimised it for independance and collaboration so 

## Building the team
- Hiring notes for Egon and Diego
- Design Day agenda, by AnaMê, Poly and Rafa
- Supporting each other on the development of our careers, by Leticia and I at UXR conf

## Setting the vision
- New ways for a credit card to work on, led by Amanda Elyss
- Launching Mexico, by Andre Mooij
- Recover the magic by covering what were once "edge cases", led by both Ana Mê Collections and Will in Limits
- Building a path to credit for the next 25MM customers, led by myself and Rafa Rozendo
- Ultravioleta, led by Amanda Legge and Diego Vieira

## Fostering trust and collaboration
- Internal peers: critiques with Amanda Elyss and retros with Diego 
- External peers: collaborating on presentations, helping create a product review forum for the Credit Card, Lending and Collections teams

Things people told me that kept me engaged building this product and team:


>You have been invaluable at onboarding PMs in Credit Card
<br>— Mariana Penido, Head of Product for Credit Card

>The credit card business unit is the most innovative at Nubank. Not because you’re launching new products all the time, but because you’ve been successful at constantly questioning what has been true/ great in the past <br> — Renata Veiga, Design Manager for Lending products

>To me it’s 100% clear Lucas doesn't work for the Credit Card business unit — nor for Nubank — but for our customers. And he knows how to go all the way back to tell how these decisions have an impact on the business
<br>— Luiza Ferraz, Product Marketing Manager
