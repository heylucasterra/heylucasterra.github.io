### Context
Soon after joining Nubank, my interest for human behaviour, business, data models and the dry access to credit in my home country swiftly drew me to focus on Nubank’s core product: the credit card.

### Growing the team
As the company jumped into hypergrowth, I organically leaned towards leadership. I was fortunate to help build this team from 1 to 10+ designers.

Credit card has been my home at Nubank for the past 3 years and the best team of product designers, user researchers and content strategists I have ever worked with.

### Impact
My main accomplishments were to:
1. **Build and maintain a cohesive team of designers**, obsessed about our current and future customers — and ready to help each other grow in their careers;
2. **Outline our vision of the future**, keeping Brazilians' favourite credit card always fresh and meaningful to them;
3. **Build a trusting and collaborative environment** for both designers and our cross-functional partners.

Let’s dive into each of these areas and some of the work done behind each of them. As with any great band, these were a group effort and not my accomplish alone. I'm happy about how we optimised our team for independance and collaboration so this is a collective story of success.

### Hiring
As I started looking for my first partner, I was documenting my thoughts on interviewing design candidates.

After the hire joined me, we started looking our next team member together — and then the next and the next. We would always looking for a great talent + personality combo that would add to our mix.

Fastforward a couple of years and our hiring process has evolved a ton. But also our rituals and the things that bond us together like a team. More recently, during the pandemic work-from-home scenario the team has come up with a "Design Studio Day" agenda so we're always collaborating, getting to know each other and

## 2. Setting the vision
From early 2018 until early 2019 the design and product teams were so focused on the day-to-day that we barely had the means to . In 2019, we started having weekly working sessions involving Product Designers, Product Managers, Product Marketing and UX Researchers.

These meetings morphed into various formats over the years but were important to have a cohesive product team, connecting the different bits of the product and opening space for looking ahead into the future.

While the current version of the future is always confidential, here are some of the bits that are pushing us into that direction.

- New ways for a credit card to work on, led by Amanda Elyss
- Launching Mexico, by Andre Mooij
- Recover the magic by solving what were once "edge cases", led by both Ana Mê Collections and Will in Limits
- Building a path to credit for the next 25MM customers, led by myself and Rafa Rozendo
- Ultravioleta, led by Amanda Legge and Diego Vieira

## 3. Fostering trust and collaboration
Trust is the seed for any autonomous and collaborative team. I feel like I've been lucky to work with people who I cou

Within our design team, there are a couple of rituals that 
1. Creative sessions are a reserved space of the week where designers can decide to run a design critique, a team discussion, 
2. Team retros are for oiling up the engines. They're usually facilitated by Diego, who also excells at designing spreadsheets such as this one

- Internal peers: critiques with Amanda Elyss and retros with Diego 
- External peers: collaborating on presentations, helping create a product review forum for the Credit Card, Lending and Collections teams

Things people told me that kept me engaged building this product and team:


>You have been invaluable at onboarding PMs in Credit Card
<br>— Mariana Penido, Head of Product for Credit Card

>The credit card business unit is the most innovative at Nubank. Not because you’re launching new products all the time, but because you’ve been successful at constantly questioning what has been true/ great in the past <br> — Renata Veiga, Design Manager for Lending products

>To me it’s 100% clear Lucas doesn't work for the Credit Card business unit — nor for Nubank — but for our customers. And he knows how to go all the way back to tell how these decisions have an impact on the business
<br>— Luiza Ferraz, Product Marketing Manager
