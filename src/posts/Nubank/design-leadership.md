### Context
I joined Nubank at the time we were a tightly-close team of 12 brand and product designers. My interests for human behaviour, business, data models and the dry access to credit in my home country swiftly drew me to focus on Nubank’s core product: the credit card.

This is a glimpse of who we are, some of the projects folks have worked on and my role and impact in it.


### Need for growth
As Nubank jumped into hypergrowth, I organically leaned towards leadership and was fortunate to help build this team from 1 to 10+ designers. Credit card has been my home at Nubank for the past 3 years and the best team of product designers, user researchers and content strategists I have ever worked with.

Things people told me that kept me engaged at building this product and team for so long
The credit card business unit is the most innovative at Nubank. Not because you’re launching new products all the time, but because you’ve been successful at constantly questioning what has been true/ great in the past
— Renata Veiga, Design Manager for Lending products


You have been invaluable at onboarding PMs in Credit Card
— Mariana Penido, Head of Product for Credit Card

To me it’s 100% clear you’re not working for the Credit Card business unit, not even for Nubank, but for our customers. And you know how to go all the way back to tell how these decisions have
