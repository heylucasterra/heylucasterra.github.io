This is a regular text and I'll try to add a line break by adding a tag `<br>`<br>
at the end of the sentence


```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

> adding a > will create a blockquote like this one. To see the possibility, the certainty, of ruin, even at the moment of creation: it was my temperament. Those nerves had been given me as a child in Trinidad partly by our family circumstances: the half-ruined or broken-down houses we lived in, our many moves, our general uncertainty. 


This is a body text named <p>
Each Markdown file is parsed into a node of type MarkdownRemark.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |

| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
 
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
 
```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.

All frontmatter fields are converted into GraphQL fields. TODO link to docs on auto-inferring types/fields.

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).




⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

This plugin adds additional fields to the MarkdownRemark GraphQL type including html, excerpt, headings, etc. Other Gatsby plugins can also add additional fields.
