### Context
In 2018 I joined a group of data analysts, programmers, anthropologists, film makers, artists and journalists to discuss the dangers of biased algorithms. The result was a series of videos on to how our biases are embedded in the lines of code shaping our lives.

### The videos
In each video we invited people to go into a conversation with an algorithm. Their goal, was to train an unbiased algorithm on 5 different topics.

Would you be able to program an unbiased machine?
