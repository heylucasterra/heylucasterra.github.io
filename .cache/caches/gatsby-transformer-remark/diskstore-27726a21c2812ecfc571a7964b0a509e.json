From the way we speak to body language, there are several ways to identify or recognize someone with looking at them. Typefaces are the equivalent to that for any written medium.</p>\n<p>Here's a practical example: Portuguese author <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valter_hugo_m%C3%A3e\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"nofollow\">Valter Hugo Mãe</a> is one of my favourite contemporary authors. I usually buy his books from the same <a href=\"http://globolivros.globo.com/autores/valter-hugo-mae\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"nofollow\">Biblioteca Azul</a> collection. The typeface <a href=\"https://blackletra.com/fonts/silva_text/\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"nofollow\">Silva</a> — made by Brazilian type foundry <a href=\"https://blackletra.com/\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"nofollow\">Black Letra</a> — morphed into his voice (or at least my perception of it) as I read his books.</p>\n<p>Picking fonts can be an everlong process if allow it to. Typography has a long history and the the web enabled an unprecedented boom of typefaces that made this process... overwhelming to put it lightly. I still have lots to learn about typography and don't consider myself an expert. In fact, since finding <a href=\"https://practicaltypography.com/\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"nofollow\">this link</a> I realized how much of a noob I am at this. For now, let's focus on what is important.</p>\n<p>Having two different typefaces would add a lot of time to this process — matching baselines is a fun artisanal process but requires too the time I want to spend learning React. For now, I'm happy to pick a single font-family that can work for both titles and body. After some digging I got to two different directions of sans-serif typographies.</p>\n<h3>Direction A - Personality without being distracting</h3>\n<p>This group of typefaces have expression just as much as they could pass unnoticed. I want my typeface of choice to feel humble, yet have personality. The selected family must work in the portfolio section, meaning they should work with multiple visual identities. It must keep readers focused on the content not the layout/style of the page itself.</p>"}
